# nv_oven_knob

Replacement oven knob, roughly modeled after original (broken) part. The back of the original part (injetion molded) part is mostly hollow; this offers little
advantage for a one-off 3D printed part, it in fact complicates the printing on an FDM style printer (requiring support material), so this feature was left out.
